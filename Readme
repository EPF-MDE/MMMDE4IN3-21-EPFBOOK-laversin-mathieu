Introduction : 

Here is the website developped to understand the basics of javascript and its extensions. 

I'm Mathieu Laversin, a student in 4th year of engineering and I propose you my website developed thanks to the 6 tutorials seen during the module. 
In order to have more interest on the development of the site, I decided to access it on the Olympic of marseille. This site is to be taken with a lot of 
of derision. The exercise 0 has been implemented as a separate page. 

It does not seem relevant to me to explain how certain steps were developed because indeed the steps are in the slideshows. 


                                    ENJOY the project, now it's time for the ReadMe content 

In order to enter the site, here are the accesses; 

Clone the project.
In the terminal : npm install and npm run dev     

                                    User : 1
                                   Password : tee

                                           OR

                                   User: test
                                   Password: test

Thanks to a cookie system, there will be no need to identify yourself a second time. 

This description will be divided into 3 steps: 

0. Exercise 0: 

    - Objective: Recover in the API of R&M 

    - Visualize the path in with the link on the home page 

    - Explanation if you prefer the explanations in a ReadMe: To recuperate the information go in Insomnia
    Thanks to the indications and the good referencing we can directly have what we want. For example with the command : 

                                    GET : https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/5

                                    Answer : Jerry Smith


1. Exercise 1 (objective, reflection, path, improvements)

    - Objective : Have a special page for each player of the equipment

    - Reflection : have a link to a page with the player id as a parameter 

    - Path : Creation of an endpoint on app.js and creation of a page profile = students_details
                    In the creation of an endpoint get the ids, in order to reuse them and in the profile page, 
                    Retrieve all the information of the player. 
    
    - Improvements : Implementation of the id directly at the creation of the player. With a method count of the lines + 1 éfféctué 

2. Exercise 2 (reflection, path, improvements): 


    -Objective: To be able to modify the student's information directly according to his Id. 

    - Reflection : Creation of a POST method on a new Ejs page linked to an app.post

    - Path : Modification of the csv, Creation of an endpoint on app.js and creation of a page profile = students_details
                    In the creation of an endpoint get the ids, in order to reuse them and in the profile page, 
                    Get all the information of the player. Modify them by creating a methodoe post and a new form page linked to the profile page
                    Home page in order to have a comfort during the navigation of the site. 
                    Since the csv was composed of several data that we wanted to keep and not change. It was necessary of the site
                    to transofmer in array and then to search as an array before applying a splice method. 


    - Disadvantages: When using the post method, it adds a row in the csv, adding a null player. 

    - How to solve the problem? Probably a row count and delete the last row. Tests have been done but in vain. 

3. Improvements of the site (visual, links..)

    - Visual : Theme on the Olympic of marseille, Creation of links, setting up of gif. 

    -Functional : Addition of the id incrementer in the method post thanks to a function recovered on stackoverflow

    - Improvements of the csv by adding details for a real csv and a real soccer team.
